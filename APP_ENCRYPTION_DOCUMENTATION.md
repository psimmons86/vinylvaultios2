# App Encryption Documentation

## What type of encryption algorithms does your app implement?

**Answer: None of the algorithms mentioned above**

VinylVault does not implement any custom encryption algorithms. The app relies entirely on:

1. Apple's built-in encryption mechanisms that are part of iOS
2. Firebase's security features for data storage and authentication

The app does not:
- Use proprietary encryption algorithms
- Implement standard encryption algorithms outside of what's provided by Apple's operating system
- Contain any custom cryptographic code

All data security in the app is handled through:
- iOS's built-in data protection
- Firebase Authentication for user authentication
- Firebase Firestore security rules for data access control
- HTTPS for secure data transmission

This approach ensures that the app benefits from industry-standard security practices without implementing custom encryption algorithms that might introduce security vulnerabilities.
