# Import Issues Solution

## Problem

The current implementation is encountering compilation errors:

```
Underlying Objective-C module 'VinylVault' not found
Cannot find type 'UserRole' in scope
Cannot find type 'CollaborationInvite' in scope
```

These errors occur because:

1. We attempted to use `@_exported import struct VinylVault.User` syntax, but this doesn't work because:
   - The VinylVault target is not set up as a module that can be imported this way
   - Swift doesn't recognize it as an Objective-C module (hence the error message)

## Solution

There are several approaches to fix this issue:

### Option 1: Move User Types to a Shared File

1. Create a new file called `UserModels.swift` in the VinylVault/Models directory
2. Move the `UserRole` enum, `User` struct, and `CollaborationInvite` struct to this file
3. Import this file in all files that need these types

### Option 2: Create a Swift Package for User Models

1. Create a Swift package for the user models
2. Move the user-related types to this package
3. Add the package as a dependency to the main project

### Option 3: Use Public Access Control

1. Add the `public` modifier to all user-related types and their properties
2. This makes them accessible throughout the app without needing explicit imports

### Recommended Approach: Option 1

The simplest solution is to ensure all files that need the User types import the User.swift file directly:

```swift
import Foundation
// Add this import to files that need User types
import User
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Remove all `@_exported import` statements (already done)
2. Add direct imports of the User.swift file to:
   - FirebaseService.swift
   - RecordStore.swift
   - UsersView.swift
3. If direct imports don't work, implement Option 1 by creating a shared models file

## Long-term Solution

For a more robust solution, consider restructuring the project to use proper Swift modules or packages, which would allow for cleaner imports and better code organization.
